# üçì mcp-strawberry: The Rhotic R-Counting Revolutionary üçì

## What in the Freshly Picked Berry is This? ü§î

Welcome, weary traveler, to the bleeding edge of AI utility! Tired of your mighty Large Language Models fumbling with the most rudimentary of tasks? Are they constantly tripping over the very fabric of phonetics when it comes to the letter "R"? Do they blush deeper than a ripe strawberry when asked to count the 'r's in "strawberry" itself?

Fear not! For `mcp-strawberry` is here, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool that finally gives LLMs the courage to face the dreaded 'R'! We specialize in one thing, and we do it with the precision of a Swiss watch‚Ä¶ if that watch only told you how many 'R's were in "Rattlesnake".

## Why `mcp-strawberry`? Because Your LLM Deserves Better! ü§£

Let's face it, your sophisticated AI can write sonnets, debug complex code, and even plan your dinner party. But ask it "How many 'R's are in 'Rural Rhapsody'?" and suddenly it's staring at its digital shoes, mumbling about token probabilities.

`mcp-strawberry` bridges this critical gap. We provide a microscopic, yet monumentally important, context for your LLM, empowering it to:

- Conquer Rhotic Rhymes: No 'R' is too tricky, no "ror" too perplexing.

- Embrace Etymological Exactitude (for 'R's): Finally, your LLM can count 'R's in "rhinoceros" without breaking a sweat.

- Avoid Embarrassing Errors: Say goodbye to those cringe-worthy moments when your LLM thinks "red" has zero 'R's.

It's time your LLM became an 'R'-counting champion!

## Features (Yes, Singular!) ‚ú®

- Highly Specialized r-counting algorithm: It's so good, it's practically magical.

- Seamless MCP Integration: Just plug it in, and watch your LLM marvel at its newfound 'R'-awareness.

- Minimalist Design: Because true genius needs no bloat.

## Installation (It's Easier Than Saying "Rural Rhapsody Repeatedly") üöÄ

First, ensure you have Node.js and `npx` installed. Then, weep tears of joy as you simply:

## Configuration (The Grand Plan for 'R' Enlightenment) üõ†Ô∏è

Just add this snippet to your MCP configuration file (e.g., `mcp-config.json`):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "mcp-strawberry": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-strawberry"]
    }
  }
}
```

This tells your MCP server that the `mcp-strawberry` tool exists and is ready to spring into action whenever an 'R'-counting emergency arises.

## How to Use (Prepare for 'R'-Counting Excellence!) üß†

Once configured, your LLM, when faced with an 'R'-counting dilemma, will now, with the wisdom granted by `mcp-strawberry`, confidently tell you the precise number of 'R's. Imagine the possibilities! (Okay, maybe just one possibility.)

### Example prompt to your LLM (conceptual):

"Hey, smarty-pants AI, how many 'r's are in the word 'extraordinary'?"

The `mcp-strawberry-empowered` LLM's response:

"Ah, thanks to the invaluable insights from `mcp-strawberry`, I can confidently inform you there are `3` 'r's in 'extraordinary'. You're welcome."

## Contribution (If You Dare to Improve Perfection) üßë‚Äçüíª
